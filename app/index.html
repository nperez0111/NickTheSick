                <p>This will be the about me section to which I refer to myself in order to further explain myself. So I begin with a set of sentences that will make myself look good in a certain manner to which you will find interesting and understandable to a certian degree so that you can later talk to me about some work that you'd like for me to do for you at some point in the future. These sentences may not be very interesting at first as I must always show my background as a first impression is a very difficult thing to shape, words on a screen are very difficult at conveying such. Therefore, I will try my hardest in being a relatable person because that is all that anybody ever wants right? We all love people who are similar to us and have similar interests even if they are very vague ones. This will lead me into saying quite distant things such as that I'm a pet person rather than stating my preference of a dog VS. a Cat. Rather than going through all of this I choose to plead the 5<super>th</super> about myself and instead offer to show you some of the work that I have completed in my next section.</p><span class="scroll down">Scroll for more</span>

                            <h2>Hal Miles Portfolio</h2>
                            <p>The Hal Miles portfolio site was a "revamp" of his existing site that implemented flash, therefore it needed to be redone in order to be compatible with mobile devices. Mr. Miles wanted no changes to the design and everything to work exactly the same as the original site, so I recreated the site using modern HTML5 and CSS3. From this site I learned that: Some people don't want or need new and "pretty" designs, some of the HTML5 video API and creating the best out of things by attempting to implement very semantic HTML.</p>

                            <p>Another of Hal Miles' sites, this site was completely redesigned to be a much more modern site and was designed by myself (Disclaimer: I am not a designer). His previous site was completely rendered as a flash object and was very outdated so, I was tasked in making this available to as wide of an audience as possible. Therefore, it is a responsively designed site which has been tested on various displays to always look optimal.</p>

                            <p>I was tasked in creating the BlueMess Productions website based upon a designer's PSD. I successfully created the site which taught me: how to stay within guidelines of a format, javascript for the album music player and that just because you made a site for someone it doesn't mean they will pay for the hosting after a year.</p>

                            <p>I made the SAS Dual-Enrollment Course finder that greatly simplifies the proccess of choosing dual enrollment courses within Miami Dade College. When choosing a class me and my peers would have to cross-reference scattered documents that would show the classes that are available to us and be able to make our entire schedule work (which is quite a tedious task that I do not recommend). This web-app makes heavy usage of JavaScript and communicates with a database that stores every course's information. This web-app taught me so much including but not limited to PHP, MySql databases, parsing of another site in order to scrape the course information and some design principles.</p>

                            <p>This is a game I wrote using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS that is similar to Tic Tac Toe but you are able to move your pieces. I had to design the entire SPA Web-App and all of the game logic implemented into an AI to play against. This taught me several concepts in JavaScript such as objects and classing within JavaScript, array manipulation and AI Logic. It also is a pretty fun game to play!
